          <h6 class="card-subtitle">Best Man</h6>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead py-2">Sri graduated a year after me from the University of Illinois MBA program. While we worked in a student-run consulting firm together for a semester, our friendship blossomed once Sri relocated to Dallas after school to work for AT&amp;T.</p>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead">Sri is the life of the party. His second home is It'll Do, a small EDM club in Deep Ellum. Never short on quirky intellectual conversation and thoughtful encouragement, Sri's a good dude.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Gonenc Mete</h5>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle">Groomsman</h6>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead py-2">Mete, as he goes, was one of my first friends at the University of Illinois MBA program. We spent many-a-night at his apartment, sipping fine whipped cream vodka, as we talked of what our future might be. Eventually, Mete had a hair-brained scheme and we worked (with McCay to boot) on a startup together tirelessly for the last semester of school.</p>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead">Now, Mete is half-a-world-away in the Valley of Silicon chips and nerdy dreams. We've had yearly re-encounters but distance certainly makes the heart grow fonder. He's a big shot now, having the honor to work along brilliant minds at the ever-desirable Facebook, each day making the world a better digital place.</p>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle">Groomsman</h6>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead py-2">McCay -- what can one say about this mild-mannered, charming Midwesterner? If there isn't a pattern, I don't know what is. McCay also attended the University of Illinois MBA program. And he was that legendary other member of our Mete-McCay-Ben startup, AngelRaise LLC.</p>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead">McCay married last year and remained in Chicago, despite his company pushing him to the East Coast. He's been at Baxter (now Shire) ever since he graduated, moving on to become an Associate Director of Health Mobile Applications.</p>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle">Groomsman</h6>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead py-2">Beyond his exceedingly important role as brother to the groom, he's kicking keister and taking names for the gub'ment. Living in Aurora, Colorado, he was recently married to his better-half last summer in ever-sweltering-but-picturesque Florida. When he's not waking up at 3am as a Guardian of the Galaxy, Matt likes to take his speedy pointer Sadie to one-hop tennis balls launched half-a-park-away.</p>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle">Maid of Honor</h6>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead py-2">Abby, soon to be Mrs. Cousert, is my sister from another mister -- the sushi to my pho. On a fateful day in the Midwest, we  met at a Latin dancing social. We hit it off with our  shared passion for rhythm. But our bond was forged through our shared values and small-town adventures. We even shared a roof for 3 years until I moved to Dallas. Before my eyes, I've seen Abby's work ethic lead her to recently becoming a leasing manager at one of the largest property management firms in Champaign-Urbana.</p>
          <p class="card-text text-left lead">Oh, and did I mention that she has 21 siblings?</p>

          <p class="card-text text-left lead pt-2">Susie is my fellow comrade sister! Vietnam and Cuba share history, cultures, and you know, that whole Communist society thing. Susie is Ben's adopted sister, yet once I met her, she instantly became mine, too. Not just a pretty face, Susie is super sweet, thoughtful, and funny. She is an interior designer and aspires to perhaps one day be an architect.</p>

          <p class="card-text text-left lead pt-2">Juno, my niece, though she will forever feel like my little sister. She is smart, witty, and full of energy, just the perfect type of partner in crime. Even though we are a decade apart, we grew up together in Vietnam. While Juno has the kind of smile to light up the room, she's an engineer by trade.</p>
