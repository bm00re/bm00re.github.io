										<p>On a not so fateful day, two of Ben's classmates introduced him to Trang, whom Ben immediately recognized, as the alluring student who posed engaging questions at a Q&amp;A for a former corporate executive earlier that semester.</p>
										<p>Ben didn't quite forget this intriguing woman, though Trang forgot about Ben as quickly as she met him. Theirs was not a story of love-at-first-sight but that of persistence.</p>

										<p>Somehow the two were connected on Facebook. Ben moved to Texas while Trang remained in Illinois.</p>
										<p>From time to time, he lived vicariously through Trang's international travels, as part of her job in the study abroad office at the university.</p>
										<p>Wanting to know which trips were bucket-list worthy -- among other things, Ben reached out a few times but nothing quite took off.</p>
										<p>That is, until Trang started looking for job opportunities in a warmer climate. Ben was excited for such an auspicious opportunity.</p>
										<p>One call led to another, which in turn led to international texting. This was going somewhere. But how to bridge the distance?</p>

									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>After one month of texting, calling, and video chatting, the two decided to meet while Trang was in Chicago for work. Without a moment's hesitation, Ben was booking a flight and restaurant reservations.</p>
										<p>Of course persistence being our central theme of this story, as Ben walked through TSA that Friday evening, the summer heat had given way to flash flooding.</p>
										<p>Reschedule, cancellation. Wash, rinse, repeat. After 24 hours in airports and planes, finally they were able to have their last first date.</p>
										<p>They enjoyed the local cuisine and boat tour. To top all of that, Trang surprised Ben on the second day...</p>
										<p>As their Uber pulled up to their destination, Ben gulped. Trang had surprised Ben with a challenge to take on his biggest fear: heights. A glass helicopter loomed before them.</p>
										<p>What a rush! The magic of the river, buildings, and city lights flickering in the background. This occassion set the stage for their future life together, one to be of excitement and adventure.</p>

										<p>The relationship grew and Trang became ready for something new.</p>
										<p>Unable to wait any longer, her boss allowed her to move to Dallas, working remotely until she was able to find a new job. So, she began networking.</p>
										<p>See, others could see what Ben had known all along. They only had to get lunch with her and be just as smitten, with her personality and smarts.</p>
										<p>By July 4th weekend she was in Texas and before the Holidays she had found her new home at Toyota.</p>

										<span class="date">December 23, 2017</span>
									</div>
									<div class="timeline-body">
										<p>At some point while Trang was in Dallas, she finally was converted to being a sushi lover, at their favorite restaurant Uchi. Trang had not appreciated uncooked seafood until one special date night.</p>
										<p>Knowing how much she longed to visit her new favorite restaurant, Ben treated Trang to celebrate her new job, their first holiday season together, and six months in the same city. Trang was satiated and happy with another night at Uchi.</p>
										<p>On the way home along Lakeside Park with the view of Christmas lights in the background, he grabbed a plush blanket and handed her a single red rose, encouraging her to walk out on the dramatically lit bridge.</p>
										<p>In the freezing cold surround by lights, Ben looked at Trang and uttered, "I know you'd rather be on a beach, but right now, there's no where I'd rather be than with you."</p>
										<p>Ben dropped to his knee and very carefully slipped a petite ring onto Trang's petite finger.</p>
										<p>Ben drove to his parents' house nearby, where they popped a bottle of Prosecco to celebrate and called Trang's family on Facebook video.</p>
